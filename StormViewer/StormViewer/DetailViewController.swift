    // Both methods have a single parameter: whether the action is animated or not. We don't really care in this instance, so we ignore it.
    // Both methods use the super prefix again: super.viewWillAppear() and super.viewWillDisappear(). This means "tell my parent data type that these methods were called." In this instance, it means that it passes the method on to UIViewController, which may do its own processing.
    // We’re using the navigationController property again, which will work fine because we were pushed onto the navigation controller stack from ViewController. We’re accessing the property using ?, so if somehow we weren’t inside a navigation controller the hidesBarsOnTap lines will do nothing.//
