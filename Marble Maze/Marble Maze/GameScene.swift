    // We need to poll the motion manager inside our update() method, checking to see what the current tilt data is. But there's a complication: we already have a hack in there that lets us test in the simulator, so we want one set of code for the simulator and one set of code for devices.
    // Swift solves this problem by adding special compiler instructions. If the instruction evaluates to true it will compile one set of code, otherwise it will compile the other. This is particularly helpful once you realize that any code wrapped in compiler instructions that evaluate to false never get seen â€“ it's like they never existed. So, this is a great way to include debug information or activity in the simulator that never sees the light on devices.
    // The compiler directives we care about are: #if targetEnvironment(simulator), #else and #endif. As you can see, this is mostly the same as a standard Swift if/else block, although here you don't need braces because everything until the #else or #endif will execute.

    // The method isn't long because it's complicated, it's long just because it does a lot. When you finish this project one of the suggested ways to improve the code is to split this method off into smaller chunks, so you should pay close attention to how it works!
    // At the core of the method it loads a level file from disk, then splits it up by line. Each line will become one row of level data on the screen, so the method will loop over every character in the row and see what letter it is. Our game will recognize five possible options: a space will mean empty space, "x" means a wall, "v" means a vortex (deadly to players), "s" means a star (awards points), and "f" means level finish.
    // Using this kind of very simple level text format means that you can write your levels in a text editor, and visually see exactly how they will look in your game. You've already tackled most of the code required for the skeleton of loadLevel(), but there are a few things I want to highlight:
        // We'll be using the enumerated() method again. In case you've forgotten, this loops over an array, extracting each item and its position in the array.
        // We'll be positioning items as we go. Each square in the game world occupies a 64x64 space, so we can find its position by multiplying its row and column by 64. But: remember that SpriteKit calculates its positions from the center of objects, so we need to add 32 to the X and Y coordinates in order to make everything lines up on our screen.
        // You might also remember that SpriteKit uses an inverted Y axis to UIKit, which means for SpriteKit Y:0 is the bottom of the screen whereas for UIKit Y:0 is the top. When it comes to loading level rows, this means we need to read them in reverse so that the last row is created at the bottom of the screen and so on upwards.
